## The Challenge
The DEFCON Badge's challenge this year involved an social interactions with an RF Badge. A regular attendee is challenged to find and touch badges with 10 different badge types (including Sponsors, Vendors, Goons, and even Press). This becomes super challenging when you have to find one of the 20 individuals out of a 30,000 person conference with an Black "UBER" badge. An exciting challenge, but for an introvert like myself - it was much easier to wall up and figure out how to flash the DEFCON27 badge to do three things:

1. Automatically complete the "touch 10 different badge types" challenge
2. Easily help our fellow nerds by unlocking their badges by having a badge that can act as a chamelion that can emulate all other badge types.
3. Profit ???

That's what the Jackp0t badge does. It automatically puts you in a "COMPLETE" win state on boot and over the course of a matter of seconds can emulate all the different badge types to unlock other attendees badges.

## Required Hardware

- [DEFCON27 Badge](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/08/first-look-at-def-con-27-official-badge-kingpin-is-back/)
- [Tag-Connect TC2050-IDC-NL-050-ALL (normal orientation)](http://www.tag-connect.com/node/199)
    - trim alignment pins if using w/ mounted gemstone â€¢ vtref provides 1.8V i/o level to debug probe
- [NXP LPC-Link2](https://www.nxp.com/design/microcontrollers-developer-resources/lpc-microcontroller-utilities/lpc-link2:OM13054) OR a [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/products/black-magic-probe)
    - These devices in conjunction with the Tag-Connect will allow you to interface with the JTAG/SWD interface on the DEFCON Badge.
- (Optional) [Micro 1v8 USB Serial UART](http://jim.sh/1v8/) OR [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/products/black-magic-probe)
    - Having UART access to the badge is super useful for debugging issues/reading badge state.

## Required Software
- [nxp MCUXpresso IDE 10.2.1](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20badge/Development%20Environment/MCUXpressoIDE_10.2.1_795.exe)
    - an IDE developed by NXP to use with the LPC-Link2. If you are flashing using the Black Magic Probe you won't need this.
- [FRDM-KL27Z SDK 2.4.1](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20badge/Development%20Environment/SDK_2.4.1_FRDM-KL27Z.zip)
    - the SDK for interacting with the MKL27Z64VDA4 microcontroller with the MCUXpresso IDE.
- [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/)
    - Powerful GNU Project Debugger. Used to interact with the Black Magic Probe to flash images

## Flashing
We confirmed two different ways to flash. One using the [LPC-Link2 + Tag-Connect Cable](#lpc-link2-setup) and one using a [Black Magic Probe + Tag-Connect Cable](#black-magic-probe-setup). Depending on your available hardware/software please reference the appropriate section.

### LPC-Link2 Setup
1. Install the [MCUXpresso IDE]((https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20badge/Development%20Environment/MCUXpressoIDE_10.2.1_795.exe)) on a Windows Machine

2. Install the [SDK](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20badge/Development%20Environment/SDK_2.4.1_FRDM-KL27Z.zip) by dragging and dropping the SDK Zip file into the MCUXpresso IDE

3. Clone the Jackp0t repo

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/NickEngmann/Jackp0t.git
```

4. Copy/Import the Jackp0t/dc27_badge folder into the MCUXpresso IDE

    <img src="./imgs/ide.png" data-canonical-src="./imgs/ide.png" width="600"/>

5. Plug the Tag-Connect Cable into the LPC-Link2

5. Attach the Tag-Connect Cable to the DEFCON27 Badge

6. Click on the Flash Button to Flash the Board

### Black Magic Probe Setup
0. [Download the jackp0t.bin binary](https://github.com/NickEngmann/Jackp0t/releases/download/0.9/jackp0t.bin)
1. Install [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/)
2. Plug in the Black Magic Probe into your computer via USB.
3. [Update the firmware on the Black Magic Probe.](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic/wiki/Upgrading-Firmware)

    We ran into a lot if issues with the default firmware on the Black Magic Probe. But if you update the firmware using the master branch of the wikia flashing the device was far more consistent.

4. Open up the arm toolchain

    ```
    $ arm-none-eabi-gdb
    ```

5. Connect to the Black Magic Probe Device via GDB

    ```
    $ (gdb) target extended-remote <device> 
    ```
    On OSX <device> is /dev/cu.usbmodem <some ##>

    On Linux <device> is /dev/ttyUSB0

6.  Touch the Black Magic Probe + Tag-Connect to the SWD pins on the badge.

    <img src="./imgs/attach-tagconnect.png" data-canonical-src="./imgs/attach-tagconnect.png" width="300"/>

7.  Use the `monitor swdp scan`  command to connect to the device using the Serial-Wire Debug Protocol .
    ```
    $ (gdb) monitor swdp scan
    ```
    Output:
    ```
        Target voltage: 1.8V
        Available Targets:
        No. Att Driver
        1      KL27
        2      Kinetis Recovery (MDM-AP)
    ```

8. Attach to the KL27 Microcontroller
    ```
    $ (gdb) attach 1
    ```

9. Allow GDB to allow access to memory outside of the devices known memory map. This is useful to allow access to memory mapped IO from GDB.
    ```
    $ (gdb) set mem inaccessible-by-default off
    ```
10. Set the binary file. Make sure the binary is in the current directory
    ```
    $ (gdb) file jackp0t.bin
    ```
11. Load the binary onto the board
    ```
    $ (gdb) load
    ```

# Future Applications
Figuring out how to edit the source code and successfully flash these badges opens the door to tons of different future hacks. Feel free to use these instructions as a jumping point to create complex hacks like turning the badge into a custom clock!
