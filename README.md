## The Challenge
The DEFCON Badge's challenge this year involved an social interactions with an RF Badge. A regular attendee is challenged to find and touch badges with 10 different badge types (including Sponsors, Vendors, Goons, and even Press). This becomes super challenging when you have to find one of the 20 individuals out of a 30,000 person conference with an Black "UBER" badge. An exciting challenge, but for an introvert like myself - it was much easier to wall up and figure out how to flash the DEFCON27 badge to do three things:

1. Automatically complete the "touch 10 different badge types" challenge
2. Easily help our fellow nerds by unlocking their badges by having a badge that can act as a chamelion that can emulate all other badge types.
3. Profit ???

That's what the Jackp0t badge does. It automatically puts you in a "COMPLETE" win state on boot and over the course of a matter of seconds can emulate all the different badge types to unlock other attendees badges.

## Required Hardware

- [DEFCON27 Badge](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/08/first-look-at-def-con-27-official-badge-kingpin-is-back/)
- [Tag-Connect TC2050-IDC-NL-050-ALL (normal orientation)](http://www.tag-connect.com/node/199)
    - trim alignment pins if using w/ mounted gemstone â€¢ vtref provides 1.8V i/o level to debug probe
- [NXP LPC-Link2](https://www.nxp.com/design/microcontrollers-developer-resources/lpc-microcontroller-utilities/lpc-link2:OM13054) OR a [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/products/black-magic-probe)
    - These devices in conjunction with the Tag-Connect will allow you to interface with the JTAG/SWD interface on the DEFCON Badge.
- (Optional) [Micro 1v8 USB Serial UART](http://jim.sh/1v8/) OR [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/products/black-magic-probe)
    - Having UART access to the badge is super useful for debugging issues/reading badge state.

## Required Software
- [nxp MCUXpresso IDE 10.2.1](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20badge/Development%20Environment/MCUXpressoIDE_10.2.1_795.exe)
    - an IDE developed by NXP to use with the LPC-Link2. If you are flashing using the Black Magic Probe you won't need this.
- [FRDM-KL27Z SDK 2.4.1](https://media.defcon.org/DEF%20CON%2027/DEF%20CON%2027%20badge/Development%20Environment/SDK_2.4.1_FRDM-KL27Z.zip)
    - the SDK for interacting with the MKL27Z64VDA4 microcontroller with the MCUXpresso IDE.
- [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/)
    - Powerful GNU Project Debugger. Used to interact with the Black Magic Probe to flash images
